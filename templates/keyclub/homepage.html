        What is the Key Club App/automation program?
    </h2>
    <p class="fs-4">
        It is a program I wrote to automate logging Key Club volunteer hours. <br>
        Normally, a Key Club officer would have to log every hour for every event manually, <br> 
        and input all the hours from the sign up sheets to the hours spreadsheet by hand,<br>
        but now they can use their Google account to log into my Key Club App, <br>
        and it will log the hours for them automatically, once they provide a link to a sign up sheet.
